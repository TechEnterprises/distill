#Distill
Distill is a Drupal module that enables other modules to extract and format
data from Drupal entities. It provides a simple class structure for defining
formatting schemas.

##How does Distill Work?
Distill contains 2 classes. 1) A processor class that contains sensible
defaults for extracting field values by field type/name, and 2) a distillation
class that takes an entity, a processor class, and a list of fields that
should be returned, executes the processorâ€™s formatter methods, and returns an
array of data.

###Distill class
`Distill` is a class that takes an entity type, entity, processor, and
language. When asked, it will go through the fields, process them with the
methods as defined in the passed-in processor, and add them to an array of
field values. It contains a few methods that allow you to ask for fields, and
grab field values.

- `setField('field_name', 'property_name', array('settings'))`: Asks the
distiller to process a given field, and add it to the array of processed fields
with the key as specified in the `property_name` parameter. This function also
takes a settings array, which gets passed into the processor class and allows
one to pass context that affects how the field value should be processed.
- `setAllFields()`: Tells the distiller that all fields should be formatted
and returned using the sensible defaults. 
- `getFieldValues()`: Returns the array of field data that has been extracted
from the given entity and processed by the distiller.

###DistillProcessor class
The `DistillProcessor` class contains methods that provide a sensible default
for extracting and formatting data from fields. The methods are called based
on the field type, or name.

You can create your own processor class that extends `DistillProcessor`, and
easily override processor methods by simply creating methods in the following
pattern:

####Field Type Processor Methods
Field type processor methods are called based on the **type** of field that's
currently being processed. The pattern for creating these method names is
`process*Typename*Type()`, where `*Typename*` is equal to the type of field
this method should process (such as `Text` or `Entityreference`).

####Field Name Processor Methods
Field name processor methods are called based on the **name** of the field
that's currently being processed. The patter for creating these method names
is `process*Fieldname*Field()`, where `*Fieldname*` is equal to the name of
the field this method should procces (such as `Fieldimage` or `Body`).

All processor methods take 3 parameters:

 - `$wrapper`: EntityStructureWrapper|EntityValueWrapper of field from which
 values are being extracted.
 - `$index`: Integer representing the delta of the field being processed.
 - `$settings`: Variable for passing in settings and context that will affect
 how the field value should be processed.

####Example
Here's a quick example implementation of this module.

```
function distill_test_page() {
  $entity = node_load(39);

  // Create instance of processor.
  $processor = new DistillProcessor();

  // Create instance ofDistill.
  $distiller = new Distill('node', $entity, $processor);

  // Specify which fields should be returned.
  $distiller->setField('title');
  $distiller->setField('body', 'post');
  $distiller->setField('field_image', 'image');
  $distiller->setField('field_integer', 'number');
  $distiller->setField('field_float', 'float');
  $distiller->setField('field_decimal', 'decimal');
  $distiller->setField('field_list_of_floats', 'floats');
  $distiller->setField('field_list_of_integers', 'integers');
  $distiller->setField('field_list_of_text', 'texts');
  $distiller->setField('field_user_reference', 'user', array(
    'include_fields' => array(
      'name',
      'mail'
    )
  ));
  $distiller->setField('field_entity_reference', 'referenced_entity', array(
    'include_fields' => array(
      'title',
      'body'
    )
  ));

  // Output JSON
  return drupal_json_output($distiller->getFieldValues());
}

```

And here's an example of an entity that's been processed and formatted as JSON:

```
{
  title: "Hello World!",
  post: {
    value: "<p>This is a post body.</p> "
  },
  image: "http://d7.local/sites/default/files/field/image/whoa.jpg",
  number: "2",
  float: "1",
  decimal: "0.50",
  floats: [
    "4",
    "5",
    "6",
    "9"
  ],
  integers: [
    "2",
    "5"
  ],
  texts: [
    "Option #2",
    "Option #3"
  ],
  user: {
    name: "admin",
    mail: "patrickcoffey48@gmail.com"
  },
  referenced_entity: {
    title: "EVERYBODY DANCE NOW",
    body: {
      value: "<p>dun dun dun</p> "
    }
  }
}
```
